\chapter{Acknowledgements}%

I would like to give thanks first and foremost to my project supervisor, Prof. Andrew Baldwin, who has provided me with bundles of support and wisdom throughout the year. Gogulan Karunanithy has aided me greatly with his expertise, especially with assistance in operating the PTCL's 600MHz NMR spectrometer. Satoshi Kishigami provided me with the $^{13}$CH$_3$-labelled samples used in this project, as well as $^{13}$CF$_3$-labelled samples, for which data acquisition is currently in progress. I would like to thank him for all our discussions relating to this aspect of the project. The entire Baldwin bunch have been a treat to spend time with over the year. As well as Andy, Gogs and Satoshi, I thank Virginia, Charlie, Magdeline, and Yixuan, for the numerous chats had over what was often a much-needed coffee.
